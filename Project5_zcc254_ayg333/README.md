Lab5

The code in this project creates and describes a graphical user interface for the critter world. 
It utilizes 2 different controllers, one for controlling the world, and another for setting up the grid. 
The user interface allows for someone to create the world, make new critters, animate the world, step through the world, and view various stats on a desired amount of critters.
Each critter has its own unique shape and color when displayed on the grid. 
Each critter is a subclass of the overarching parent Critter class, and they each have their own unique functions as well.
